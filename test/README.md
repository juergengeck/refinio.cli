# Refinio CLI Test Suite

This comprehensive test suite provides extensive API testing for the refinio.cli package as explicitly requested. The test implementation covers all major components and commands with thorough unit testing, integration testing, and command testing.

## Test Structure

### Test Configuration
- **Jest Configuration**: `jest.config.js` with TypeScript support via ts-jest
- **Global Test Setup**: `setupTests.ts` with mock helpers and global utilities
- **Test Utilities**: Mock factories and shared test helpers

### Test Coverage Overview

#### 1. Client Layer Tests (`test/client/`)
- **QuicClient.test.ts** (734 lines): Comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - Connection establishment and management
  - Person keys authentication with challenge-response
  - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, List)
  - Profile operations (Create, Get, Update, Delete, List)
  - Recipe operations (Register, Get, List)
  - Request timeout handling and error scenarios
  - Connection recovery and malformed message handling

- **ProfileAwareClient.test.ts** (397 lines): Profile-aware client tests covering:
  - Profile-based connection establishment
  - Automatic profile loading on connection
  - Profile context for operations
  - Fallback behavior when profiles are not found
  - Factory function testing for client creation

#### 2. Credential Management Tests (`test/credentials/`)
- **LocalCredentials.test.ts** (491 lines): Complete credential management testing:
  - Local storage operations (load, save, encryption)
  - Instance management (add, remove, list, set default)
  - Person key generation with cryptographic validation
  - Key import/export functionality with validation
  - Error handling for malformed data and missing files
  - Custom storage path support

#### 3. Command Layer Tests (`test/commands/`)
- **profile.test.ts** (528 lines): Profile command testing covering:
  - Profile creation with official one.models Profile structure
  - Profile listing with filtering options (--my flag)
  - Profile usage and default setting
  - Profile display with detailed information
  - Profile updates and deletion with confirmation
  - Error handling for missing connections and profiles

- **connect.test.ts** (400+ lines): Connection command testing covering:
  - Instance connection with existing keys
  - Key generation with email validation
  - Key import from files with validation
  - Default instance management
  - Connection listing and removal with confirmation
  - Authentication error handling

- **recipe.test.ts** (300+ lines): Recipe command testing covering:
  - Recipe registration from JSON files
  - Recipe retrieval by name
  - Recipe listing with type filtering
  - File I/O error handling
  - JSON validation and parsing errors

- **crud.test.ts** (500+ lines): CRUD command testing covering:
  - Object creation from inline data and files
  - Object reading with version support and file output
  - Object updates with partial data
  - Object deletion with confirmation
  - Object listing with pagination (limit, offset)
  - Comprehensive error handling for all operations

#### 4. Integration Tests (`test/integration/`)
- **profile-operations.test.ts** (632 lines): End-to-end Profile workflow testing:
  - Complete Profile lifecycle (create, read, update, delete)
  - Multi-Profile management scenarios
  - Profile error scenarios (conflicts, unauthorized operations)
  - Profile integration with CRUD operations
  - Connection recovery during Profile operations

## Test Features

### Comprehensive Mocking
- **one.core dependencies**: Fully mocked QUIC transport and cryptographic functions
- **File system operations**: Mocked fs/promises for file I/O testing
- **External dependencies**: Mocked inquirer, ora, chalk for CLI interaction
- **Console and process**: Mocked for output and exit code testing

### Test Utilities
- **Global test helpers**: Shared mock data for Person keys, instances, and Profiles
- **Mock factories**: Reusable mock objects for consistent testing
- **Error simulation**: Comprehensive error scenario testing

### Testing Patterns
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure with setup, execution, and verification
- **Mock verification**: Thorough verification of mock calls and parameters
- **Error path testing**: Comprehensive coverage of error scenarios
- **Async testing**: Proper async/await patterns with timeout handling

## Key Test Scenarios Covered

### Authentication & Security
- Person key generation and validation
- Challenge-response authentication flow
- Signature verification and error handling
- Unauthorized operation detection

### Data Management
- Profile creation using official one.models Profile structure
- CRUD operations with proper validation
- Recipe registration and hierarchical filtering
- Version management and conflict resolution

### Connection Management
- Multi-instance connection support
- Default instance management
- Connection persistence and recovery
- Network error handling

### CLI User Experience
- Command option validation
- Interactive prompts and confirmations
- Progress indicators and user feedback
- Error messages and exit codes

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm test -- --watch        # Run in watch mode
